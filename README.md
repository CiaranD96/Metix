# Metix
A reminder application built using Meteor, Blaze, Bootstrap and fullCalendar. The application lets users register an account, login under
their username and create reminders. Users can also see other users reminder, but can only delete their own reminder. Users can also
check their reminder as completed. Reminders are stored in MongoDB collections.Users can also click on a modal that displays a calendar 
from fullCalendar and can create reminders using the calendar if they wish. Reminders will then be displayed on the calendar.
