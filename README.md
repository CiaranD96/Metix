# Metix
A reminder application built using Meteor, Blaze, Bootstrap and SASS.
This application allows users to create an account, log in and set custom reminders. Reminders are stored in MongoDB collections and are
displayed back to the user. The user can delete their own reminders, but not other users. Users can also mark reminders as completed or 
delete them entirely.

#Installation
Once the repo has been cloned or downloaded, cd in to the project folder using the command line and run "meteor npm install" and then
"meteor run".
